Peak leaf area index (LAI) was estimated at ∼1 with ∼40% canopy cover [Nouvellon et al., 2001]. Following the peak of the drought (2003–2006), most native bunchgrasses were dead with widespread shrub mortality, and the grassland since 2007 has been dominated by Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana). ",From Maoya's notes,https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/US-Wkg
