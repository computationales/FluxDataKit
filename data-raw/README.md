# Data collecting and formatting routines

This directory contains scripts to collect / populate basic data used in the
FluxDataKit workflow (formal product output, not the package as such). Some
data is provided with the repo (such as ancillary and meta data folders), other
data is too large and needs to be downloaded separately, using included scripts
or manually due to login walls on download APIs.

Scripts need to be executed in order, and data directories need to be populated
for them to function.

## Scripts

- 00_download_plumber_data.R - downloads PLUMBER-2 data
- 01_collect_meta-data.R - collects meta-data given downloaded data
- 02_compile_final_site_list.R - using the data set age determine the most recent version
- 03_convert_plumber.R - converts PLUMBER-2 data to a FLUXNET format to ensure parity with other final data outputs
- 04_download_modis_data.R - collect required MODIS products (FPAR/LAI)

## Data provenance

Data was sourced from different locations:

- PLUMBER-2: https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/5fdb0902607e1. Can be downloaded using [an included script](https://github.com/geco-bern/FluxDataKit/blob/main/data-raw/00_download_plumber_data.R)
- The latest Ameriflux release, downloaded data on 14 Oct 2023 from https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/.
- ICOS Drought2018 release from https://doi.org/10.18160/YVR0-4898.
- ICOS WarmWinter2020 release from https://doi.org/10.18160/2G60-ZHAK.
- MODIS LAI and FPAR data ([MCD15A2H Collection 6.1](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd15a2hv061/), doi:10.5067/MODIS/MCD15A2H.061) 

## Data structure

Data should be structured in the following directory structure and referenced
to as such in the data generation workflow:

```
data/
   ├─ modis/
   ├─ flux_data/
      ├─ fluxnet2015/
      ├─ icos/
      ├─ oneflux/
      ├─ ameriflux/
```
